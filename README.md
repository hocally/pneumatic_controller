# varible-position-pneumatic-controller
The goal of this project is to achieve variable position control of a pneumatic cylinder using closed-loop feedback via a bidirectional solenoid valve, a pneumatic cylinder, a string potentiometer, limit switches, and an Arduino Nano with supporting control circuitry. If this project is successful, it will be ported over to Java for use on an FRC RoboRio.
